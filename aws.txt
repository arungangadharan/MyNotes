DETAILS
=========
IAM
- Centralized control of your AWS account
- shared access to your AWS account
- Granular permissions
- Identity Federation
- multi factor authentication
- temp access to devices
- helps in password rotation policy
- integrates with different AWS services
- supports PCI DSS compliance
- IAM does not have a region
- users
- groups
- roles
- policies

S3
- simple storage service
- Object based storage
- saves files
- Block based  - for programs
- 0 to 5 TB
- stored in bckets
- each bucket has a DNS name - globally unique
- region.amazonaws.com/bucket name
- HTTP 200 - success
- Data consistency model
	- read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects means. a new object creation will be reflected immediately
	- eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES 9 - will take time to sync
-  storage is key-value pair. Key is the name of the file and data is a sequence of bytes of data (content of the file)
- then we have version as well
- metadata as well
- sub-resources
	- access control list (ROLE BASED PERMISSION)
	- Torrent (for torrenting)
- 99.99% availability
- 99.9999999% durability
- Tiered storage available
- life cycle management
- versioning
- encryption
- Secure data using ACL and bucket policies
- S3 standard : 99.99 availability and 99.9999999% durability. acessable across multiple devices in multiple facilities. designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities
- S3 - IA :Infrequently accessed. for data that does not get accessed often. Lower fees than standard, but retrieval is charged
- S3 one Zone - IA : infrequent accessed which does not require multiple availability zone resilience
- Glacier : Very cheap - only for archiving
	- expedited :  retrieval takes only few minutes
	- Standard : retrieval takes 3-5 hours
	- Bulk : Retrieval takes 5-12 hours
Charging for
	- storage
	- requests made to the resource
	- Storage management pricing : Who owns and who can access
	- Data transfer pricing : for transferring across different regions
	- tranfer acceleration : for using high speed transfer network in amazon
- versioning cannot be disabled (once enabled), only suspended
- frequent changing does not need versioning
- upload the same file again, it gets saved as a different version
- you can delete any version
- versioning stop deleting functioning op as well
- if the file is deleted, it is still available in version with a tag ' with a delete marker'. if we go and delete the file of that kind, it just deletes the delete marker and restores the original file. So the front end delete does not delete the file. since it maintains multiple versions of the same file, it is not ideal to enable versioning of frequently changing files
- MFA delete is an option to enable multi factor authentication for versioning and delete operations. this can make the operations secure
- this stops people from accidently deleting files

Cross region replication
- to enable this, we need to have versioning enabled first
- this cross region replication, can be done across AWS account - can cover AWS acocunt of others as well
- while mentioning replication policy, we can mention the storage class as well. We usually mark it as 'Stanard - IA' if you want to use it as a backup with infrequent access
- it also requires an IAM role.
- when you enable replocation, only new and modified objects are going to be moved to the new bucket
- how do copy objects of one bucket to another bucket. this is easy to do over command line


AWS CLI
- add a usr through UI
- get program access, not console access
- enter access key id and secrett access key
- default region, 
- aws s3 ls - will list the buckets
- copying to another bucket : aws s3 cp --recursive s3://<from-bucket> s3://<to-bucket>
- when you delete a file in source, destination file also get deleted, however if we cancel delete in source bucket the destimation is not replicated
- Update operations also get updated in destination bucket
- deleting a latest version in source does not delete a verrsion in destination
- replication cannot be done across multiple buckets

Configuring transtions
- this canconfigure to move current version to stanard IA after a certain period and then to glacier
- craete a bucket. go to management > life cycle > add life cycle policies
- we can add tags along with life cycle policy
- add transition to the current version. can just say transition the current version to IA after 30 days and to glacier after 60 days
- can do the same with previous versions as well
- also we can say object expiry. Can say that object to be marked as expired after a period of time



Cloud front/CDN
- CDN is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver web pages and other web contet to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the web page and content delivery server
- Edge location is the place where data is cached, Orgin is where data is originally saved. Distribution is the network of edge locations
- when a user accesses data in a remote location, at first the data fecthing is slow. howver after first fectch, the data get stored in an edge location. After that, repeated request will fetch data from the edge location only.
- edge locations support write operations as well. You can create an object in an edge location and it gets automatically replicated in origin
- set a TTL for an object : Time to Live. once that's done, the object will be available in cache. it cannot be removed till TTL completes. However, you can clear the cache, however you will be charged for that.

- to create a distribution
	- go to cloud front
	- create distribution; there are two types - web and RTMP. web uses HTTP/HTTPS communication. RTMP is for adobe tools
	- Origin domain name is the name of the origin bucket
	- Origin path is a folder within bucket
	- Origin ID is just a name
	- restrict bucket access - says that public cannot access the content using the origin bucket URI. everyone has to use edge location for that
	- Origin access identity - need to check
	- Grant Permissions on bucket -if yes, it automatically updates policy file
	- Path pattern can be used to mention the type of file accessible
	- viwer protocol policy can be used to mention HTTP, re-direct HTTP folks to HTTPS or HTTPS only
	- Allowed HTTP methods. mention allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST..etc)
	- Can mention caching mechanism - custom ot orgin cache headers
	- can mention minimum and maximum TTL (time to live). this should be in seconds
	- restrict viewer access(use signed URLs or signed cookies )- need to check
	- AWS WAF Web ACL is for restricting access  - need to check
	- CNAMEs are alternate human readble name - generated names are tough to read
	- custom error pages possible -> under error pages tab
	- geography based restrcition also is possible - under Restrictions tab
	- geo- restrictions - you can either white list or black list
	- invalidations - for invalidatig objects from an edge locations
